# Simple Calculator using LABVIEW
This repository is about creating a simple calculator using LABVIEW. Operators that I did here is just simple add, subtract, multiply and divide and equal. The reason for me doing this calculator exercise is to get more familiar to LABVIEW.

### Using Queue for getting every inputs
There will be various approaches to complete this program. The appraoch I took here was using Queue. 
Using Queue's ***FIFO***(First-In-First-Out) property I can ensure that every button pressed is properly recoreded and transfers into processing loop.
